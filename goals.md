# Knowns

React stuff will be rendered on the server by the Django server shelling out to Node, running a render script, and injecting the returned JSON into a template in the appropriate places.

This means there will be no need to run the react dev server - simply going to localhost:8000 will forward requests to the server-side rendering javascript.

THAT means we initially lose some nice features.  Hot reload is gone, (if it was there in the first place), automatic reloading is gone, automatic recompilation is gone, linting is gone...

None of that matters in production though.
