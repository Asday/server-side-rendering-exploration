# Server Side Rendering Exploration

Nothing like a bit of experimentation.

Current progress and a slightly better idea of what's going on is hanging out in the [goals](goals.md).

# Developing

```shell
nvm install 10
npm i
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
./watch
# In a separate shell
./manage.py runserver
# In yed another separate shell
npm start
```

# Running tests

```shell
detox
npm run test
```
